    "__Your task:__ Explain in words why the protocol you implemented in Question 1 provides perfect privacy. That is: even though Alice, Bob, and Carol receive messages in this protocol, describe why they cannot learn anything about David's data. We anticipate that a response here should be around 1-2 paragraphs in length; that said, you may use any combination of words, code, formulas, figures, etc as needed to answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Your response__: In my implementation of the secure MPC procol, perfect privacy is achieved by ensuring that each computing party (Alice, Bob and Carol) receives only parts of the data necessary to compute a function but not enough to reconstruct the original inputs. David splits each of its inputs (a, b, c) into 3 random shares, such that their sum modulo 256 (e.g. `a1 + a2 + a3 % 256` for a) equals the input. As a result, no single share or even a pair of shares can reveal any information about David's inputs due to the randomness and independence of the other shares. This follows the principle of perfect privacy."
