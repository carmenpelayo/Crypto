    "The goal of this assignment is to continue our investigation into the structure of a blockchain. We'll continue to use the toy blockchain from Programming Assignment 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Everything else in this assignment overview is identical to what we wrote in Assignment 3; it is here to remind you of how the toy blockchain works, and so that you execute the appropriate Python commands again.]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python classes\n",
    "Our toy blockchain is written as Python code, which we provide below. We separate the blockchain into four classes:\n",
    "- The `TransactionPayload` class holds the relevant information for a single payment: the sender and receiver (identified by their public keys) and the amount of money being transferred.\n",
    "- The `Transaction` class contains the payload together with a digital signature made by the sender.\n",
    "- The `Block` class contains the block \"height\" (which is just a 0-indexed counter), a set of new transactions, and a pointer to the previous block in the chain. Additionally, the block contains a `nonce` that can be chosen arbitrarily by the block's miner in order to satisfy the difficulty rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `blockchain` object is a list of blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this assignment, the difficulty rule is that:\n",
    "> _The hash of a valid block must begin with 8 bits (one byte) of all 0s_.\n",
    "\n",
    "To instantiate these classes, execute the Python code below."
